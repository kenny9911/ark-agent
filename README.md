# ArkAgent

**Hire an AI employee, not another app.**

ArkAgent is a full-stack platform for **hiring autonomous AI agents** that run on dedicated VMs — selling, supporting, recruiting, and writing for you around the clock. You brief an agent like a person (role + instructions + rules), pick its channels, and manage it from the web console **or** from the messaging apps you already use (Telegram / WhatsApp / WeChat / LINE / Slack / Email).

🌐 Live: **[arkagent.ai](https://arkagent.ai)** (global) · **iagent.cc** (中国大陆)
🔑 Demo login: **`demo` / `demo123`** — opt-in via `npm run db:seed:demo`, and **refused in production**. It is a guessable credential and the workspace behind it owns real agents, billing seats and paid invoices. Every account you register starts empty.

---

## Four harnesses, one control plane

An agent runs on a **harness** — the runtime that actually executes it on its VM. ArkAgent supports
four, behind one configuration surface:

| Harness | Positioning | Best for | Provisionable today |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenClaw** | Portable skills + local execution (shell / files / browser / docker) across 10 channels | Outreach, support, channel-heavy roles | **Yes** |
| **Hermes** (Nous Research) | Model-agnostic provider with a self-improving learning loop | Research, long-horizon "one-person company" ops | **Yes** |
| **Codex Harness** (OpenAI) | Repository-scoped coding agent, pinned to its own model family | Engineering work inside a codebase | Not yet — see below |
| **DeepSeek Harness** | Files-and-network agent, pinned to its own model family | Document and data work | Not yet — see below |

All four read the same portable `SKILL.md` format from `.agents/skills/`, so a skill is not written
per harness — compatibility is about *runtime dependencies* (binaries, environment, config), which
is what the Skill Repository records.

**Codex and DeepSeek are in the enum, the schema and the code, but gated out of every picker.** The
OpenClaw Manager has not assigned them a `category_id`, so [`categoryIdFor()`](lib/harness/provisioning.ts)
throws rather than guessing — previously a two-way branch on a four-value enum would have
provisioned a *Hermes* VM for anyone who hired a Codex agent, silently. Enable them with
`ATG_ENABLED_HARNESSES` once the runtime team assigns ids.

Capability claims are **tri-state** ([`lib/harness/profiles.ts`](lib/harness/profiles.ts)):
`yes` / `no` / `unknown`. `unknown` means *nobody has verified it*, and it never renders a control —
a switch built on an unverified claim is one that silently does nothing.

> ArkAgent is the **control plane**: it owns identity, workspaces, agent configuration, billing and
> the operator UI. It does **not** run agents. A separate **Agent Manager** provisions a VM per
> agent, deploys the harness, monitors it and bridges it to channels. ArkAgent calls it over an
> outbound HTTP API and receives HMAC-signed webhooks back. In development an in-process **mock**
> stands in; **in production an unconfigured runtime returns `503` rather than simulating one.**

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | **Next.js 16.3** (App Router, Turbopack, React Compiler) |
| UI | **React 19.2** + **TypeScript 5** (strict) |
| Database | **Postgres** + **Drizzle ORM** (`postgres-js`), migrations via `drizzle-kit` |
| Auth | Custom email + HTTP-only session cookies (`node:crypto` scrypt; only token SHA-256 stored) |
| Validation | **Zod 4** at every request boundary |
| Styling | Inline-style design system in [`lib/theme.ts`](lib/theme.ts), responsive. Three brand directions — **Terminal Lime**, **Ivory Studio**, **Midnight Console** — each in dark + light, ported from the Claude Design source |
| i18n | English / 简体中文 / 繁體中文 / 日本語 — natively written, persisted per user |
| LLM | **OpenRouter** (model-agnostic via `LLM_MODEL`) — agent replies, brief generation, self-review |
| Payments | **Stripe** (USD, international) + **Alipay** via the GoHire gateway (CNY, 中国大陆) — one price ladder in [`lib/pricing.ts`](lib/pricing.ts), integer minor units end to end |
| Scheduling | A dependency-free cron engine with IANA time zones and explicit DST policy ([`lib/schedule/cron.ts`](lib/schedule/cron.ts)) — no npm package |
| Tests | **`node:test`** via `tsx` — no test framework dependency |
| Hosting | **Vercel** (Node 24 LTS), two cron entries in [`vercel.json`](vercel.json) |

Runtime dependencies are intentionally tiny: `next`, `react`, `drizzle-orm`, `postgres`, `zod`, and `stripe` (the only SDK — the Alipay gateway is plain `fetch`).

---

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** Node 24 (see `.nvmrc`) and a Postgres database.

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
#   Fill in DATABASE_URL + DIRECT_DATABASE_URL. Nothing else is required to run
#   locally: payments start in mock mode and the agent runtime is simulated
#   until you add keys. Set CRON_SECRET if you want to exercise the scheduler
#   tick — those routes fail closed without it.

# 3. Apply the schema + seed reference data (plans, roles, platform admin)
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed

#    …and optionally the demo workspace (dev/CI only; refused in production)
npm run db:seed:demo

# 4. Load the skill catalogue so /dashboard/skills has something to show
npm run skills:seed

# 5. Run
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000 (or an exported PORT)
```

After `npm run db:seed:demo`, sign in with **`demo` / `demo123`** to explore a fully-populated workspace, or **create an account** (a real email is required) to start with an empty one.

### Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server |
| `npm run build` / `npm start` | Production build / serve |
| `npm stop` | Gracefully stop Next.js servers in this checkout |
| `npm restart` / `npm run restart:dev` | Stop, then start the dev server |
| `npm run restart:prod` | Stop, then serve the existing production build |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run db:generate` | Generate a SQL migration from the schema |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply migrations (uses `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`) |
| `npm run db:push` | Push the schema directly (dev shortcut) |
| `npm run db:studio` | Open Drizzle Studio |
| `npm run db:seed` | Seed reference data only — plans, agent roles, the platform admin |
| `npm run db:seed:demo` | Also build the demo workspace (dev/CI only; throws in production) |
| `npm run db:check` | Replay every migration into a scratch database, fresh **and** incrementally |
| `npm test` | Unit tests (`node:test` via `tsx`) |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run llm:check` | Verify `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` + `LLM_MODEL` work end-to-end |
| `npm run pricing:check` | Assert the USD/CNY price ladder, annual math and currency routing (no DB, no keys) |
| `npm run payments:check` | Assert the Stripe/Alipay mode resolution, including the production fail-closed |
| `npm run skills:seed` | Load the curated skill catalogue into the database |
| `npm run skills:sync` | Refresh the Skill Repository from its allowlisted sources |

Stop/restart requires macOS or Linux (including WSL) with `lsof` and `ps`.
`npm stop` sends SIGTERM to every Next.js dev/production server whose working
directory is this checkout, regardless of port, and waits up to 10 seconds for
shutdown. It succeeds if none are running and fails if shutdown times out, so
restart cannot continue after a failed stop. Other projects and other processes
are left running. These commands manage local Next.js CLI servers; use the
deployment platform or Docker Compose to manage hosted/containerized services.

Restart runs in the foreground. `npm restart -- --port 3001` forwards flags to
the new dev server; `npm run restart:prod -- --port 3001` does the same for production.
Previous CLI flags are not remembered. Production restart uses the last build;
run `npm run build` first to include code changes. Set `PORT` in the shell (for
example, `PORT=3001 npm restart`), since Next.js cannot read the listening port from `.env`.

**Agent runtime.** `AGENT_MANAGER_MODE=mock` uses the in-process simulator; `live` plus `AGENT_MANAGER_BASE_URL` talks to a real Agent Manager. Unset, it is inferred — and **in production it resolves to `unconfigured`, which returns `503`**, because a simulated fleet reports every agent as working, invents VM ids and uptimes, and bills for a seat behind which no machine was ever started.

**Schedules.** With `CRON_SECRET` set you can fire the tick by hand:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" http://localhost:3000/api/cron/schedules
```

It claims due schedules, dispatches them, advances `next_run_at` and records a run. It is safe to call twice — the claim protocol makes a duplicate fire impossible.

**LLM.** Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `LLM_MODEL` (an OpenRouter id like `openai/gpt-5.6-luna`; an `openrouter/` prefix is accepted and stripped) to enable real agent replies, hire-brief generation and self-review. Without a key the app falls back to seeded defaults and the deterministic template generator, so it still runs — except that in **production** agent chat returns `503` rather than streaming a canned reply that only looks like a model. Run `npm run llm:check` to confirm the key and model resolve.

**Payments.** With no payment keys configured, checkout is fulfilled inline — you get a real subscription and a real paid invoice without an external account, so the whole flow works on a fresh clone. See [Payments](#payments) below.

## Features

| Area | What works, backed by the database and API |
|---|---|
| **Auth** | Register / login (email *or* username) / logout, plus Google and WeChat SSO. scrypt + HTTP-only cookie sessions; only the token's SHA-256 is stored |
| **Template gallery** | `/dashboard/templates` — browse agent templates in **card or list view**, filter by role, harness, category and difficulty, and open a detail drawer showing all six configuration sections |
| **AI-guided creation** | Describe what you need in plain language; the **Agent Template Generator** drafts every section for you to review and edit before anything is created |
| **The six sections** | ROLES · AGENTS · SKILLS · RULES & BOUNDARIES · CONTEXT (file upload + pasted text) · REMINDERS & SCHEDULERS — all persisted to Postgres for the runtime to read |
| **Skill Repository** | `/dashboard/skills` — searchable catalogue with a **deterministic risk score** (no model needed), harness compatibility, and an SSRF-guarded sync pipeline that lands discovered skills as `draft`, never `published` |
| **Reminders & schedulers** | Natural-language scheduling in four languages, a dependency-free cron engine with real IANA/DST handling, a per-minute tick with an exactly-once claim protocol, and per-schedule run history |
| **Agent management** | Full configuration editing — brief, rules, skills, context, schedules, harness, channels, limits — with a config revision the runtime polls so a save that has not reached the VM says so |
| **Activity** | Timeline, run drill-down with step traces, health and uptime, token and credit analytics |
| **Fleet & chat** | Roster, live feed, streamed chat in the agent's persona, self-review queue, pause / resume / terminate |
| **Channels** | Telegram · WhatsApp · WeChat · LINE · Slack · Email · Feishu · DingTalk · WeCom (secrets masked on read) |
| **Billing** | Credits and per-agent usage computed from real `usage_records`, invoices, and seat purchase via **Stripe** (USD) or **Alipay** (CNY) |
| **i18n & theme** | EN / 简 / 繁 / 日, three brand directions × dark and light — six palettes, all meeting a written contrast contract enforced by tests |

### Accessibility and contrast

The colour ramp has a contract, and it is a test rather than a comment:

| Tier | Floor | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `--c-text` | ≥ 13:1 | headings, values, active nav |
| `--c-text2` | ≥ 9.5:1 | **default body copy** |
| `--c-muted` | ≥ 7:1 | secondary copy and every mono label |
| `--c-faint` | ≥ 4.5:1 | **tertiary only** — timestamps, placeholders, never a sentence |

Every tier is measured against all four surfaces it can be painted on, in all six palettes, by
[`tests/contrast.test.ts`](tests/contrast.test.ts) — which parses `app/globals.css` itself, so a
hand edit cannot pass while the tokens say otherwise. The stylesheet previously *claimed* AAA in a
comment and was wrong in five of six palettes.

## Payments

ArkAgent sells one thing — an **agent seat** — into two markets, with two currencies and two providers:

| Market | Currency | Provider | Seat renewal |
|---|---|---|---|
| International | **USD** — $49 / $149 / $399 per month | **Stripe** hosted Checkout | Stripe subscription, renews itself |
| 中国大陆 | **CNY** — ¥349 / ¥1,068 / ¥2,868 per month | **Alipay**, via the GoHire gateway | one-off payment opening a fixed period (30 days monthly, 365 annual); renewal is a fresh purchase |

Annual is billed up front at **−20%**. CNY is a local price ladder, not an FX conversion of the USD one. Both live in [`lib/pricing.ts`](lib/pricing.ts) as **integer minor units** (US cents / 人民币分) — nothing in the money path is ever a float, and no screen hardcodes a currency symbol.

A seat is granted only when the provider confirms out of band (`/api/webhooks/stripe`, `/api/payments/alipay/callback`), never by the browser returning from the payment page. Fulfilment is exactly-once by a conditional claim on the order row inside a single transaction, which also writes the subscription, the invoice and an audit row — so a provider retry, a concurrent redelivery, or a crash mid-fulfilment all land somewhere safe.

**In development, with no payment keys at all, the app still works end to end** — checkout fulfils inline and creates a real subscription and invoice, which is what keeps the demo and a fresh clone usable. **In production that fallback is deliberately unavailable**: an unconfigured provider returns `503` rather than quietly handing out paid seats for free.

> **Setting it up for real?** [**docs/PAYMENTS.md**](docs/PAYMENTS.md) has the full architecture, every env var, and step-by-step operator checklists for what to do in the Stripe Dashboard and what to ask the Alipay gateway operator for.

## Status

Verified on every change: `npm run typecheck` · `npm test` · `npm run lint` · `npm run build` · `npm run db:check`.

**Not yet true, and worth knowing before you demo it:**

- **Nothing writes the run, step or health tables yet.** The Activity page reads them correctly and
  its empty states are the launch-day experience by design — the runtime team implements
  [the contract](docs/BACKEND_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md) against them.
- **Codex and DeepSeek cannot be provisioned** until the OpenClaw Manager assigns them category ids.
- The Skill Repository ships a curated catalogue; the discovery sync lands new skills as `draft`
  for review rather than publishing them.

---

## Deployment

Deploys to **Vercel** from `main`. See [**docs/DEPLOYMENT.md**](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for the complete
guide; the essentials:

1. Set the env vars from `.env.example` in project settings. At minimum `DATABASE_URL`,
   `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` — the app refuses to start in production without
   the last one rather than minting unreachable localhost callback URLs.
2. Run migrations as a **release step** (`npm run db:migrate`), never on the request path. Verify
   first with `npm run db:check`, which replays every migration into a scratch database both from
   empty *and* incrementally.
3. Seed reference data with `npm run db:seed`. Do **not** set `SEED_DEMO` — the demo workspace is
   refused outright under `NODE_ENV=production`.
4. Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. The repository default is a published credential.
5. Set `CRON_SECRET`. The cron routes fail **closed** without it — an unauthenticated tick could
   otherwise fire every schedule in the database on demand.

### The one migration rule

`ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE` goes in its own migration file containing **nothing else**.

drizzle wraps every *pending* migration in a single transaction, and Postgres refuses to *use* an
enum value added in that same transaction — unless the type was created there too. That exception is
the trap: on a fresh replay every type is created in the one transaction, so **CI is always green**,
while a deployed database receiving the same batch fails and rolls the whole thing back. **It breaks
production, not CI.** `npm run db:check` replays real deployed states to prove it, and its error
message says exactly this.
