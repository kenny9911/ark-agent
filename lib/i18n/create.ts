/**
 * Copy for the AI-guided agent creation flow (docs/UI_DESIGN_V2.md §C).
 *
 * Three screens — DESCRIBE, GENERATING, REVIEW & EDIT — plus the six section
 * editors. Written natively in each language rather than translated word for
 * word: a 简体中文 user describing a job to a new hire does not phrase it the
 * way an English speaker does, and the DESCRIBE screen lives or dies on
 * sounding like a person asking a normal question.
 *
 * The stage labels are the ones fixed by docs/AGENT_TEMPLATE_GENERATOR.md §9.2.
 * The SSE `label` field is English and for logs only; the screen always renders
 * `t.generating.stages[stage]`.
