/**
 * PATCH  /api/agents/[id]/skills/[skillId] — enable/disable, or replace config.
 * DELETE /api/agents/[id]/skills/[skillId] — detach.
 *
 * `[skillId]` addresses ONE ATTACHMENT of one skill to one agent. Both readings
 * of the segment resolve: the attachment id (`agent_skills.id`, which is what
 * `AgentSkillDTO.id` carries) and the catalogue id (`agent_skills.skill_id`,
 * which is what a caller holding a skill row has). Both are matched only within
 * this agent, so neither can reach another tenant's row.
 *
 * The workspace check runs first and on its own: `getAgentRow(id,
 * ctx.workspace.id)` before anything touches `agent_skills`. A cross-workspace
 * agent id is a 404, and so is a well-formed attachment id that belongs to
 * someone else — the two are indistinguishable from outside on purpose.
 *
 * What PATCH cannot change: `state`, `version`, `harness`, `origin`,
 * `riskLevelAtAttach`. `updateAgentSkillSchema` has no keys for them. State is
 * the runtime's to report; re-pinning a version in place would swap what is
 * installed while leaving the risk snapshot that was taken for the old one, and
 * that is a detach plus a fresh attach, which re-runs every gate.
